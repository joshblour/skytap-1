      An asset is a file you upload to support your work in Skytap Cloud.

      Assets may include nightly builds, ISOs, test data, training manuals or
      any other files. Skytap Cloud also provides a set of public assets.

configuration:

      A configuration is a virtual workspace that contains one or more virtual

      A configuration also defines how VMs leverage the public internet and/or
      secure access via VPN access to a corporate data center. A configuration
      may be running, suspended, stopped or powered off. You may save the exact

        Create an export job, allowing Skytap VMs to be downloaded locally.

        The VM must be part of a template and must be powered off.

        Once Skytap has finished processing the VM, the export job's status
        will be "complete." You may then download the VM file using FTP.

        The name of the downloadable file is "vm.7z," a compressed file in
        7-Zip format. Once extracted, your VM disk will be present as
        "session.vmdk" and your VM configuration file will be present as
        "session.vmx." Depending on the configuration of your VM, there may be
        other file types.

      single-URL published set contains a single URL mapped to a set of VMs,
      whereas a multiple-URL published set generates a unique URL for each VM
      in the set.

      configurable allowing you to create VMs that mirror your production
      machines easily. The "power" of a VM is measured as Skytap Virtual

vpn:
  description: |
      A VPN (virtual private network) refers to an IPsec network tunnel
      connecting a Skytap configuration to an outside server (such as a
      corporate intranet).

      A VPN resource connects to one logical external endpoint. There may be
      many Skytap configurations connected simultaneously to one VPN, as long
      as the network subnets of any two running configurations do not overlap.
      Additionally, you may create multiple VPN resources if you want to
      connect your configurations to more than one external endpoint.
